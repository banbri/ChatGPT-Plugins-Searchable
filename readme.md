## Project Description

- Say goodbye to the frustration of searching page by page. If the OpenAI official doesn't provide a search function, we'll implement it ourselves!
- The underlying technology uses the OpenAI GPT-3.5 embeddings interface, supporting search in any language.
- The search interface is from ChatPlugin.top.
- If you find this script helpful, you can show your support by giving it a ⭐️STAR.
